# Rendle
A platform for renting idle stuff

# some issues for the existing renting platform
1. how to gurantee the guy who is going to rent my stuff won't damage my stuff?

# solutions
1. the 2 users should be in the same city and trade face to face. The owner should choose the renter based on the profile he/she uploaded. As a first experiment for my own use case, I only choose my friend to rent.

# requirements of the product
I want to narrow down the field into filming equipment which might not be used that often for an individual.
